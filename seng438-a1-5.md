# Introduction

This lab aims to test the system using specific unit tests that target the main functionalities of the application. Before this lab, we knew basic software testing fundamentals, such as exploratory and manual function testing. Exploratory testing would entail ad hoc and unscripted testing, where testers would use their experience and intuition to find inherent flaws in the system without using pre-made tests. Manual function testing is a more thoughtful way to consider multiple cases by using pre-established tests to confirm that the system behaved as expected.

Our goal in this lab was to apply manual function testing to an ATM simulation system in order to further our understanding. This will help to identify the benefits and challenges of this testing method while gaining hands-on experience with manual function testing.
