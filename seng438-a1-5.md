# Introduction

This lab aims to test the system using specific unit tests that target the main functionalities of the application. Before this lab, we knew basic software testing fundamentals, such as exploratory and manual function testing. Exploratory testing would entail ad hoc and unscripted testing, where testers would use their experience and intuition to find inherent flaws in the system without using pre-made tests. Manual function testing is a more thoughtful way to consider multiple cases by using pre-established tests to confirm that the system behaved as expected.

Our goal in this lab was to apply manual function testing to an ATM simulation system in order to further our understanding. This will help to identify the benefits and challenges of this testing method while gaining hands-on experience with manual function testing.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory testing aimed to find as many flaws as possible in the ATM simulation system (System Under Test, or SUT) by mimicking real user interactions. In addition to assessing error handling for invalid inputs, incorrect PINs, and system constraints, our methodology concentrated on testing essential features, including login, withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries. Our goal was to evaluate the system's overall stability and user interface responsiveness in various scenarios.

We employed a procedure that compromises extensive coverage and targeted testing. First, we ensured that every significant feature was tested at least once. Then, we focused on high-risk domains, including cash handling, transaction processing, and PIN validation. We also examined edge instances, such as boundary values like the withdrawal limit and improper inputs like incorrect PIN entries.

Every testing couple conducted a 30-minute exploration session in which they freely engaged with the system and noted any issues they came across. With thorough descriptions, reproduction instructions, anticipated and actual outcomes, and severity levels, these flaws were entered into the defect tracking system. We were able to identify possible system vulnerabilities thanks to the insights gathered from this step. We were able to quickly identify important flaws and obtain practical expertise with real-world testing methods thanks to this methodical yet adaptable methodology.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

Our team of 4 was split into 2 pairs, each pair handling the testing of different use cases. One pair (Alex, Zaid) handled testing for the deposit, transfer, inquiry, and PIN extension use cases. The other pair (Aidan, Odin) handled testing for the system startup, system shutdown, transaction and withdrawal use cases, as well as some general session testing.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Testing was divided and completed efficiently and no issues or challenges were encountered. Pair testing proved to be an effective method.
